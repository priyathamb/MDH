# MDH
Mahabubabd District Hospital
This is the application intended to dedicate the medical services to the MDH(Mahabubabd District Hospital) as a free service initiative from the young folks of Mahabubabd. Aim of this application is to digitalize the hospital fully to avoid manual introversion or paper usage going further. Which will allow the hospital/patients/doctors/administration/members to do their job in a smart/advanced/quick/accurate/simple/flexible/maintainable manner.

Kudos!!
